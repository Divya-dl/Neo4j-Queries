# Creating and Querying the Graph Model (Course - Provider)

### CREATE:


```
CREATE (p :Provider);
```


![title](Images/1.png)

* A node with a label Provider is created.


```
CREATE (p :Provider {name: 'one.com', location: 'USA'})
return p;
```


![title](Images/2.png)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ![title](Images/3.png) 

* A node with a label Provider  and properties with name and location in key value pair is created. 


```
Create (c :Course {code: 'udm004', title:'Neo4j', tags: ['nosql', 'neo4j', 'database'] , price: 37})
Return c;
```


![title](Images/4.png)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ![title](Images/5.png) 

* A node with a label Course  and properties with code,price,tags and title in key value pair is created.



### MATCH:


```
match (p :Provider {name: 'one.com', location: 'USA'})
return p;
```


![title](Images/2.png)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ![title](Images/3.png) 

* A node with the given properties is matched in the same pattern and returned.


```
match (p :Provider {name: 'one.com', location: 'USA'})
```


![title](Images/6.png)

* Using match command alone produces an error.



### RETURN:


```
match (p:Provider),(c:Course)
return p,c;
```


![title](Images/7.png)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ![title](Images/8.png) 

* Nodes with different labels are matched and returned.



### CREATE RELATIONSHIP:


```
match (p :Provider {name: 'one.com', location: 'USA'}),(c :Course {code: 'udm004', title:'Neo4j', tags: ['nosql', 'neo4j', 'database'] , price: 37})
create (p)-[pb:PUBLISHED {year:2015}]->(c)
return p,pb,c;
```


![title](Images/9.png)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ![title](Images/10.png) 

* A relationship between two nodes with a year property is created.



### SET:


```
match (p:Provider {name:â€™one.com', location: 'USA'}) set p.location='India'
return p;
```


![title](Images/2.png)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ![title](Images/11.png) 

* The location property of a node is updated from USA to India.



### WHERE:


```
match (n :Provider) 
where n.location='India'
return n;
```


![title](Images/2.png)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ![title](Images/11.png) 

* The node with the location specified in where condition is displayed.



### REMOVE:


```
match (p :Provider {name: 'one.com'})
remove p.location
return p;

```


![title](Images/2.png)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ![title](Images/12.png) 

* A key and its corresponding value is removed.



### DELETE:

To delete, first create the node:


```
Create (c:course{name:'gcp'})return c;
```


![title](Images/13.png) 

* The node is created.


```
match (c:course{name:'gcp'}) delete c;
```


![title](Images/14.png) 

* The node is deleted.



### MERGE:


```
MERGE (n:Course {title:'GCP'}) 
ON CREATE SET n.nickname=['gcp_create','google_create'] 
ON MATCH SET n.nickname=['gcp_match','google_match']
RETURN n;
```


![title](Images/15.png)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ![title](Images/16.png) 

* The student node with name Thomas does not exist and hence it is created with the nickname indicated in ON CREATE command.

**Executing the same query again:**


![title](Images/15.png)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ![title](Images/17.png) 

* The student node with name Thomas already exist and hence the nickname is changed to the one indicated in ON MATCH command.



## Before proceeding further:


To clear the entire database:

1) First the relationship between the nodes must be deleted.
```
MATCH ()-[r]-() DELETE r;
```
2) Then the nodes must be cleared.
```
MATCH (n) DELETE n;
```


## Aggregation Commands:

*Note:Execute the below query to obtain the same output as displayed.*
